#### Question 3. How many rows are there for the Yellow Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020? (1 point)
- Answer : 24,648,499
- Solution :
1. Due to the fact that in the CSV data for yellow taxis in 2020, there are 280 data points with years outside of 2020. Using time extraction alone is not sufficient to obtain valid results, so string matching is required to obtain the desired results. The following is the SQL query used:

```SQL
SELECT 
COUNT(1) AS "Jumlah Data"
FROM public.yellow_tripdata
WHERE filename LIKE '%2020%';
```

#### Question 4. How many rows are there for the Green Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020? (1 point)
1. As before, in the 2020 green taxi data, there were 53 data points with years other than 2020, so string matching was required to obtain the desired results.
- Answer : 1,734,051
- Solution :

```SQL
SELECT 
COUNT(1) AS "Jumlah Data"
FROM public.green_tripdata
WHERE filename LIKE '%2020%';
```

#### Question 5. How many rows are there for the Yellow Taxi data for the March 2021 CSV file? (1 point)
- Answer : 1,925,152
- Solution :
```SQL
SELECT 
filename,
COUNT(1) AS "Jumlah Data"
FROM public.yellow_tripdata
WHERE 
filename LIKE '%2021-03%'
GROUP BY filename;
```

#### Question 6. How would you configure the timezone to New York in a Schedule trigger? (1 point)
